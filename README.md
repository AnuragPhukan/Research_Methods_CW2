The "Research_Methods_CW2" GitHub repository is structured to facilitate the exploration and understanding of the environmental impact of different diets through data visualization. Within the repository:

- The `Dataset` folder contains the crucial CSV file `Results_21Mar2022.csv`, derived from the study referenced in the project, providing the raw data for analysis.
- The Jupyter Notebook `Research_Methods_Coursework_2.ipynb` includes the Python code responsible for the data analysis and generation of the treemap visualization. This file is central to the visualization process.
- For an optimal experience, it is recommended to open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab, as GitHub's interface cannot display the dynamic treemap generated by the code. Colab provides a fully interactive environment where the treemap and other visual outputs can be viewed as intended.
- The visualization itself is published via GitHub Pages, allowing for direct access to the rendered interactive treemap without the need to run the code.

This repository is structured to ensure ease of access and reproducibility, inviting further exploration and potential collaboration on this and related topics.
